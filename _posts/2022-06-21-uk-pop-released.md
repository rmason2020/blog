Announcement: The United Kingdom Point of Presence (UK POP) is now GA!

What is UK POP and why are we doing it?

UK POP GA means the VMware Carbon Black Cloud hosted in the AWS-London region is now generally available.
The United Kingdom was selected as the next region for VMware Carbon Black Cloud after researching regional addressable market and corresponding compliance requirement complexity. Customers in the UK lead the rising trend for data to stay in the country it was derived. Launching a Point of Presence in the United Kingdom invites VMware Carbon Black to have a seat at the table for the growing number of customers with this demand.
What does UK POP offer? Who will have access to the first release?
The Carbon Black Cloud in the United Kingdom will include:
Endpoint Standard
Enterprise EDR
Audit and Remediation
Cloud Workload Protection
Vulnerability Management for Workloads
Vulnerability Management for Endpoints

The first release of UK POP will be accessible to standalone customers. UK POP is not available to partners (including resellers, distributors, MSPs or MSSPs) at this time.
What is unique about UK POP?

CSP (Cloud Services Platform)
The new Point of Presence in the United Kingdom is the first Point of Presence entirely built on VMware’s Cloud Services Platform (CSP). This allows customers to access the Carbon Black Cloud from VMware’s unified Cloud Services Console, enhancing the identity and access management capabilities of the Carbon Black Cloud, and standardizing the Carbon Black Cloud with other solutions used by VMware customers and partners.
Avira
For UK POP, automatically uploading potential malware to Avira will be OPT-IN, as opposed to the previous setting of OPT-OUT.  This is because of the preference for data localization. This is a permanent change. 
What is not included in UK POP? Who does not have access to the first release?

The first release Carbon Black Cloud offering in the UK will not include:
Managed Detection
Container Essentials or Advanced

Partners and customers requiring multi-tenancy (parent-child organization hierarchies) will not have access to the first release of UK POP. This is because of the lack of multi-tenancy functionality on CSP (the portal for customers - with which UK POP is compatible) and CPN (Cloud Partner Navigator, the portal for partners - with which UK POP is not yet compatible).
