## Welcome to Richard Mason's Blog

Notes made getting started with this blog

Enable github pages, create a repo > settings pages.  You will need to create three DNS records, I use Go Daddy and had to create

A forwarding record to forward richm.cloud to www.richm.cloud

A cname record to point www.richm.cloud to rmason2020.github.io 

A CAA record allowing letsencrypt.org to issue certificates for richm.cloud.  This last step is if you want to enforce https.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rmason2020/blog/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
