Welcome to Richard Mason's Blog

This site has been created as a central repository for me to share and store my thoughts and day to day technical findings.

Built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub the site should expand as a blog enabling me to share links and reference back to what I was doing at any particular time and place.
