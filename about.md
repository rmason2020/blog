# About page

My name is Richard Mason.  I work for VMware most recently as a Client Solution Architect based in the Security Business Unit, formerly Carbon Black.  O am also an Ambassador for the Office of the CTO.

I have worked in IT Security for 20 years, previously as a Professional Services consulatnt with Value Add Resellers.

I am based near Winchester in the south of England and live on a farm where I used to work prior to a career in IT.  The environment is a key passion of mine and I strive to grow food, source locally and sustaiably whereever possible.
